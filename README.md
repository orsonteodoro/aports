# My gift to the Alpine Linux community

These may not likely get merged because your distro maintainers prioritize Docker Containerization 
(mostly for use in corporate and business environments) ahead of the interests of Desktop Linux and 
not desktop performance that most us home users only care about.

These packages have been sitting in the pull queue for more than a month.  It was a waste of time 
contributing to them and few packages (surf and bug fixes) get only get accepted.

I refuse to contribute any more unless more until 50% of my packages get accepted in a timely manner.

I think this game of delaying pull request is a conspiracy to milk more free labor which I have totally
no interest in working with.  (I just only wanted to add/install the package; nothing more.)  They 
expect us packagers to do double duty in labor with this testing policy which is already been done 
upstream; typically used as scafolding in building their product.  Also, I find it suspicious and 
playing games that you are optimizing for O(1) on code review to possibly game the GitHub daily 
contribution system.

I am done with this distro and never coming back.
